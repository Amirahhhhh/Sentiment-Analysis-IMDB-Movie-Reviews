Sentiment-Analysis-IMDB-Movie-Reviews
Sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using classical machine learning and deep learning models, with evaluation, tuning, and visualisation techniques.

## 1.	ðŸ“Œ PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to perform sentiment classification on the IMDB movie review dataset, which contains 50,000 labelled movie reviews. The reviews are categorized as either positive or negative, enabling the development of a binary classification model. This task falls under Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text analytics, making it an ideal case study for comparing traditional ML and DL approaches.
The dataset is split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 for testing, offering a robust benchmark for experimentation with various models and techniques.
